#Required Libraries

To successfully run the script, you need to install the following Python libraries:

NumPy - Provides support for large multidimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions.

```pip install numpy```

OpenCV (cv2) - Used for image processing, feature extraction, and transformation.

```pip install opencv-python```

scikit-image (skimage) - Used for image processing tasks such as feature detection.

```pip install scikit-image```

matplotlib - Required for visualizing images and plotting results.

```pip install matplotlib```

#Installation Instructions

To install all dependencies at once, run:

pip install numpy opencv-python scikit-image matplotlib

#Running the Script

To execute the scripts in 'classical' or 'deep_learning', run the following command:
